/**
 * This module will be spawned as a separate language server process by the 'extension.ts'.
 * In the extension it is declared as 'server-main' (see webpack.config.js for the packaging).
 *
 * This module does the following:
 * - Establishing the connection with the language client that is running in the extension
 * - Create a Langium-based language server that fulfills the language server protocol based on that connection
 * - Create a Node-based GLSP server that can access the language server directly and runs on a dedicated port
 * - Create a RPC-based model server that exposes an API to access the Langium AST/semantic model on a dedicated port, e.g., for form-access
 */
